The Gaeilge Gach Lá Challenge is a free lead-magnet for Bitesize Irish. A guided week of creativity, reflection and cultural expression. No grammar drills, just soulful connection.

How we deliver it is get leads to submit a form integrated with Active Campaign, email them daily, and then point them to a specific page on this Bitesize Irish site for each day.

Engagements is via Wordpress comments (using the Thrive Comments plugin which makes the UI nicer).
